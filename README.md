## 🚩 Challenge 5: Multisign

🎫 Deploy a Multisign contract to learn the basics of multisigning withdraws and deposits to a DAO Treasury on the Flow blockchain and Cadence. You'll use:
- The local Flow emulator to deploy smart contracts. 
- The local Flow dev wallet to log into test accounts.
- A template Next.js app with sample scripts and transactions to interact with your contract.

🌟 The final deliverable is a DApp that allows anyone to deposit $FLOW to a DAO Treasury, of which admins must multisign actions to withdraw that $FLOW from the Treasury.
